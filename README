ABOUT:

oban hopes to simplify the deploy process for apps on heroku that use
submodules

INSTALL:
  cp oban /usr/bin/.

Example Deploy:
  me@myhost:~/my_proj$ oban

TODO:
  * first commit of course looks like shit
  * have to manually specify heroku remote for now in oban
  * creds file doesn't quite work yet as it needs to be in same directory
